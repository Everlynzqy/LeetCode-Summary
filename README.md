# LeetCode-Summary

Hi, everyone. I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in USC. My courses start from this fall(2016) and end in spring 2018(2 years). 

Currently, I'm preparing for the upcoming Recuitment. Despite a beginner right now, I will keep on the practicing process on [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/). I will write down summaries, including solution optimizing methods and some thoughts，for some tricky problems from my perspective. And hope it's helpful to you. If there is any question or mistake, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!
