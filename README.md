# LeetCode-Summary

Hi, everyone. I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in USC. My course starts from this fall(2016) and ends on 2018 spring (2 years). Here is my Linkedin Profile.

Currently, I'm preparing for the upcoming Recuitment. Despite a beginner right now, I will keep on the practicing process on LeetCode OJ. I will write down my own summary, including solution optimization methods and some thoughts on it，for some tricky problems from a beginner's perspective. And hope it's helpful to you. If there is any question or mistake, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!
