# LeetCode-Summary

Hi, everyone. I'm a graduate student majoring in Computer Science in USC. My courses start from this fall(2016) and end in spring 2018(2 years). Here is my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tongzhang1994).

Currently, I'm preparing for the upcoming Recuitment. Despite a beginner right now, I will keep on the practicing process on [LeetCode OJ](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/). I will write down my summary, including solution optimizing methods and some thoughts，for some tricky problems from a beginner's perspective. And hope it's helpful to you. If there is any question or mistake, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!
